# Developer Tools
Developer tools (or "development tools" or short "DevTools") are programs that allow a developer to create, test and debug software.

Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website. They let users inspect and debug the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allow to inspect the network traffic it causes, make it possible to measure its performance, and much more.
